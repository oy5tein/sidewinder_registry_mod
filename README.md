Windows 10 registry settings for MS Sidewinder 1.0 to make it work in windows 10

Finally made a 1998 Microsoft Sidewinder Precision Racing Wheel USB version 1.0 work in Windows 10.

What this regestry hack does (i think) is it tell the games it is a racing wheel with a Z axis (for braking)

Tested in WRC7 (i had to manually detect axis and assign them to make it work)
